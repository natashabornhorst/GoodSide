### Tech plan and milestones
9/10

Please make repo public and move everything to the wiki. I would avoid leaving the matching algorithm to the end,
as you want to have that ironed out so you can show how different inputs will change the output in your algorithm.
Make sure to leave room for things that go wrong or things that take longer than expected. Regardless of what you
accomplish milestone wise, make sure you have a working demo for the business plan competition. Split up your plan
into target and reach milestones, so that you can have a mvp working asap.
